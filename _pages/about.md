I am a second-year Computational Mathematics Ph.D. student at Emory University advised by Dr. Matthias Chung.  My interests lie in the applications of optimization, inverse problems and numerical linear algebra in scientific machine learning, algorithmic fairness and medical imaging.  I recently graduated with a B.S. in Applied Mathematics and a B.A. In Computer Science from Case Western Reserve Unviersity.
